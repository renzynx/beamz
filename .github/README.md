## Recommended (preferred) — Docker Compose

Deployment guide — the repository includes example proxy compose files in `config/` (Caddy, Traefik, nginx, Apache, Envoy).

- To use a provided proxy setup:
  - Copy your preferred compose file (for example `config/docker-compose.caddy.yml`) to the repository root, or create a `docker-compose.override.yml`.
  - Run `docker compose up -d` to start the stack.

Proxying must be configured for the application to work.

This is the simplest and recommended way to deploy locally or on a server that supports Docker.

1. Clone the repo and change into it:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/renzynx/beamz
   ```

   ```sh
   cd beamz
   ```

2. Configure (optional):
   - The default `docker-compose.yml` uses the image `ghcr.io/renzynx/beamz`.
   - If you want to run the built image locally, build it then use the compose file or update the `image:` value.

3. Environment variables (set via compose file or environment):
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `BASE_URL=https://example.com` — The URL you are deploying to
   - `SECRET=32-characters-random-string-for-secret`

4. Volumes (compose) mount:
   - `./uploads:/app/uploads` — persistent file uploads
   - `./data:/app/data` — sqlite DB files

5. Start the stack (detached):

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. Check logs (optional):

   ```sh
   docker compose logs -f
   ```

Now your application should be running at http://localhost:3000

## Manual deployment (no Docker) — for advanced / debugging

This assumes you have `bun` installed and want to run the services directly on a linux host.

1. Install dependencies at repo root:

   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

2. Build packages:

   # Build DB

   ```sh
   cd packages/db
   ```

   ```sh
   bun run build
   ```

   # Build API

   ```sh
   cd ../api
   ```

   ```sh
   bun run build
   ```

   # Build background jobs

   ```sh
   cd ../background-jobs
   ```

   ```sh
   bun run build
   ```

   # Build web

   ```sh
   cd ../web
   ```

   ```sh
   NODE_ENV=production NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 bun run build
   ```

   # copy web standalone assets

   ```sh
   cp -r public .next/standalone/packages/web/
   ```

   ```sh
   cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/packages/web/.next/static
   ```

3. Prepare runtime data and run migrations:

   ```sh
   cd ../../packages/db
   ```

   ```sh
   bun dist/migrate.js
   ```

4. Start services (backgrounding with & for linux shell; use a process manager in production):

   # API

   ```sh
   cd ../api
   ```

   ```sh
   bun dist/index.js &
   ```

   ```sh
   API_PID=$!
   ```

   # Web

   ```sh
   cd ../web
   ```

   ```sh
   bun .next/standalone/packages/web/server.js &
   ```

   ```sh
   WEB_PID=$!
   ```

   # Background jobs

   ```sh
   cd ../background-jobs
   ```

   ```sh
   bun dist/index.js &
   ```

   ```sh
   JOBS_PID=$!
   ```

   ```sh
   echo "API: $API_PID, WEB: $WEB_PID, JOBS: $JOBS_PID"
   ```

Important:

- Running multiple processes in one environment is fragile. Use systemd, supervisord, or container orchestration in production.
- The Docker image in this repo uses an Alpine-based Bun runtime.

## Building the production Docker image locally

1. Build the image (from repository root):

   ```sh
   docker build -t <your-namespace>/beamz .
   ```

2. Optionally push to a registry:

   ```sh
   docker tag <your-namespace>/beamz ghcr.io/<your-namespace>/beamz:latest
   ```

   ```sh
   docker push ghcr.io/<your-namespace>/beamz:latest
   ```

3. Update `docker-compose.yml` `image:` field to point to your image or run the compose file using the built local image.

## Troubleshooting

- Logs:
  - Use `docker compose logs -f` to stream logs for all services.
